        TUTOR'S COMMENTS AND ADVICE TO STUDENT: <br /><br />Paul, Well done for getting your assignment uploaded. Some satisfactory work done here in your responses, but it was incredibly difficult to mark because of your formatting. Make sure in your next assignment, that you double check that you have upload the correct number of files. As you progress on other courses, you won't be given a second chance.<br />
It was helpful adding a header with all your information at the top of your TMA.<br />
Below, you will find I have given you a few comments, as well as this summary. These comments may help you to develop your academic and professional skills and perhaps, encourage you to think about what, if anything, you might do differently on the next assignment. You will find below, my notes in green and any errors in yellow.<br />
Question 1 was well answered. Through your academic career you will create a lot of notes, storing them appropriately is important. Part b)&nbsp;&nbsp;your OpenStudio submission link was incorrect.<br />
Question 2 was generally OK, but you didn't show evidence of your music reducing.<br />
The database question, question 3 was the most difficult for you and you seemed to get a little mixed up.<br />
You used a variety of HTML styles in question 4, to try and make your piece an attractive web page, but missed out a copy of your text and a screenshot. It is really important at this level to follow instructions to the letter.<br />
Question 5a) was quite good, but missing examples.<br />
5b) The purpose here was to start a PDP activity which will be continued through the next two assignments. PDP is an important process throughout the IT industry and something which external agencies such as the British Computing Society see as an important element in any computing degree. Your PDP attempt was fair, but again missing specifics. Such as: describe one occasion on which you have successfully demonstrated one of the following aspects.<br />
You have demonstrated some fair practical skills and your writing style is also very good. Overall, you are working at a fair standard.<br />
Remember to make use of the tutorials, both recorded and live?&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many tutorials on the topic of Block 2 and preparation for TMA02.<br />
The next iCMA42 is due by 19th June. 2025 and TMA02 is due on 17rd Jul. 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned, there are a number of tutorials scheduled over the next few weeks, it's well worth trying to get to some, as they will help in understanding the material and how to tackle the next TMA.<br />
Try to visit our cluster group forum and post your Block 2 questions to that forum.&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll also find many posts on Block 2 topics.<br />
