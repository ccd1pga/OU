In an FR I the peak surface‑brightness occurs within the inner half of the source, 
giving an FR ratio < 0.5, whereas in an FR II the hot‑spots are at the extremities 
so the ratio > 0.5. Visual inspection of Figs 1 & 3 shows the bright knots are 
(respectively) near the core and at the lobe edges, so Fig 1 must have FR ratio < 0.5 
(type I) and Fig 3 > 0.5 (type II).

\[ L = \frac{GM\dot{M}}{R} \]
\[ L_{Edd} = \frac{4\pi GMm_{p}\textit{c}}{\sigma_{T}} \]

\begin{align*}
\stext{hence}\\
\frac{GM\dot{M}}{R}  &=  \frac{4\pi G M m_{p} c}{\sigma_{T}}\\[8pt]
\frac{GM\dot{M}}{4\pi GMm_{p} c} &= \frac{R}{\sigma_{T}}\\[8pt]
\frac{\dot{M}}{4\pi m_{p} c} &= \frac{R}{\sigma_{T}}\\[8pt]
\dot{M}_{\text{Edd}} &= \rb{\frac{4\pi m_p c}{\sigma_T}}R
\end{align*}

As \( \pi, m_{p}, \textit{c}, \sigma_{T} \) are all constants this shows that
maximum accretion rate depends only on the radius of the accreting object

\vspace{3cm}

And as 
\[ R = \frac{2GM}{\textit{c}^{2}} \]

\[
    \frac{2GM}{\textit{c}^{2}} \Longrightarrow \dot{M}_{\text{Edd}} = \rb{\frac{8\pi G m_{p}}{\sigma_{T} c}}M
\]

and thus the the maximum accretion rate of a black hole depends only on its mass

\begin{question}

    Slide 1:
    In May 2023, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration detected a gravitational-wave signal, 
    GW230529, during the early part of its fourth observing run. The event was picked up 
    by the LIGO Livingston detector while the other observatories were offline or not 
    sensitive enough. This signal came from a binary merger involving a compact object 
    with a mass between 2.5 and 4.5 times that of our Sun, and a neutron star between 
    1.2 and 2.0 solar masses. What makes GW230529 especially intriguing is that the more 
    massive object sits in the so-called ‘lower mass gap’—a previously underpopulated 
    range between the heaviest known neutron stars and the lightest known black holes. 
    This detection adds compelling new evidence to the growing case that nature might 
    be more adventurous in populating this gap than previously believed.

    \vspace{5cm}
    
    Slide 2:
    GW230529 was detected on 29 May 2023 at 18:15 UTC by the LIGO Livingston detector. 
    It was a strong signal, standing out from background noise and independently confirmed 
    by three search pipelines using matched-filtering techniques. These pipelines 
    compare real-time data to theoretical templates, and in this case, all three 
    flagged GW230529 as highly significant. The signal’s strength was such that even 
    though only one detector was operational, the false alarm rate was estimated 
    at less than one in a thousand years—making it an extraordinarily reliable detection. 
    The waveform of the signal suggests a merger between two compact objects: one 
    significantly heavier than the other, with the heavier component likely lying 
    in the mass gap region between neutron stars and black holes. This event marks 
    one of the most asymmetric mass ratios observed in neutron star–black hole mergers.
    
    \vspace{5cm}

    Slide 3:
    he binary system responsible for GW230529 had a primary object with an 
    estimated mass between 2.5 and 4.5 solar masses, and a secondary object 
    between 1.2 and 2.0 solar masses. This puts the heavier component squarely in 
    the “lower mass gap,” a region previously thought to be empty. The total mass of 
    the system was around 5.1 solar masses, with a chirp mass, the effective mass 
    of a binary system (black holes or neutron stars able to produce detectable 
    gravitational waves), in the context of the Quadrupole Gravitational Radiation 
    emitted by it.—one of the most precisely measurable properties of a 
    gravitational-wave event—of about 1.94 solar masses. The spin of the primary 
    was measured to be moderate, and the system as a whole showed no signs of 
    precession. Although we can’t be 100\% sure of the nature of the heavier object, 
    statistical analysis suggests it's more likely to be a low-mass black hole 
    rather than a massive neutron star. Meanwhile, the lighter companion is 
    almost certainly a neutron star, based on its mass and lack of strong spin 
    evidence. The system was located roughly 200 million light-years away, based on its redshift.
    
    \vspace{5cm}

    Slide 4:
    Because GW230529 was only detected by a single observatory—LIGO 
    Livingston—localising its position in the sky was challenging. 
    Without input from the other detectors, the sky area where the signal 
    could have originated remained broad. This poor localisation made it difficult 
    for telescopes to follow up with electromagnetic observations. Despite this, 
    several observatories attempted follow-up campaigns, including searches 
    for gamma-ray bursts, neutrinos, and optical transients. No significant 
    electromagnetic counterpart was identified. However, models suggest that 
    tidal disruption of the neutron star—and thus visible emissions—is only 
    likely under specific conditions, such as a high spin and favourable mass ratio. 
    For GW230529, those conditions weren’t definitively met, and the amount of matter 
    expected to be left outside the black hole post-merger was likely too small to 
    power a bright visible signal.
    
    \vspace{5cm}

    Slide 5:
    GW230529 is a landmark detection for several reasons. First, it adds weight to 
    the growing evidence that the so-called ‘lower mass gap’—the region between the 
    heaviest neutron stars and the lightest black holes—is not as empty as once thought. 
    Previously, neutron stars were found through radio or X-ray emissions, typically 
    under 2.5 solar masses, and black holes were seen in X-ray binaries, mostly above 5. 
    This left a gap that may have simply reflected observational bias. Gravitational-wave 
    detections, like GW230529, don’t rely on light and can reveal compact objects 
    solely through their mass and motion. The discovery of a likely black hole with 
    a mass in the 3–5 solar mass range challenges previous assumptions and could reshape 
    our understanding of stellar collapse and compact object formation. It also nudges 
    models of supernova physics and binary evolution toward accounting for lower-mass black 
    holes and more diverse merger pathways.
    
    Collaboration scientists say roughly 80 more strong candidates are already under study, 
    and they expect the tally of gravitational‑wave detections to top 200 by the end of O4.
