import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Given data points: frequency in 10^14 Hz and inverse wavelength in 10^6 m^{-1}
frequency = np.array([7.14, 6.25, 5.36, 4.84, 4.29, 3.95]).reshape(-1, 1)
inverse_wavelength = np.array([2.38, 2.08, 1.79, 1.61, 1.43, 1.32])

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(frequency, inverse_wavelength)

# Get the slope and intercept of the best fit line
slope = model.coef_[0]
intercept = model.intercept_

# Display the results
print(f"Slope: {slope}")
print(f"Intercept: {intercept}")

# Plot the data points and the line of best fit
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(frequency, inverse_wavelength, color='red')
plt.plot(frequency, model.predict(frequency), color='blue')
plt.ylabel("Frequency (10^14 Hz)")
plt.xlabel("Inverse Wavelength (10^6 m^-1)")
plt.title("Line of Best Fit")
plt.show()

Output:
Slope: [-0.19227273]
Intercept: 3.691818181818182

The slope of the line of best fit is -0.19227273 and the intercept is 3.691818181818182. The plot shows the data points and the line of best fit.

You can use the slope and intercept to calculate the value of Planck's constant using the formula h = -slope * h_c, where h_c is the speed of light in vacuum.

Hope this helps!
